In an age of rampant misinformation, it is more important than ever to be able to quickly, reliably check the validity of the information one finds online. TruthSniper is a Google Chrome extension that enable users to quickly fact-check information they find online through three well-established fact-checking sites: Snopes, Politifact, and Google Fact Check. 

Simply highlight key words in a section of text that you would like to fact-check and open the extension. The highlighted text is automatically inserted into a form to be submitted to one of the three fact-checking sites. The form can also be manually edited to include any additional information you would like to check. Clicking the button for the respective site opens a page with search results from that site.

This extension works by accepting user input through the form field as a string, then parsing the string for any irregularities, URL encoding and formatting the string, and opening a hyperlink to the selected fact-checking site with the string as the search query. The highlight functionality is enabled by injecting a content script into the webpage that listens for a request from the extension and then sends the selected text to the extension.

By providing quick, easy access to fact-checking, TruthSniper will help combat misinformation and aid users in finding clarity in their online browsing.
